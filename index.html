        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Tech Startup Club is a club at Earl of March Secondary School 
            that gathered after school on Fridays to apply their knowledge together to start 
        tech projects (as the name would imply). </p>
        <h2>What happened to it?</h2>
        <p>Members eventually lost interest in the project of the year which was a social media app about lost and found items. Its scope was slightly too large for its members to handle alongside their usual academic responsibilities. This particular website is an example of something unable to be realized in that time period. </p>
        <h2>What is it doing now?</h2>
        <p>The current year project is a virtual tour of the Earl of March building. Development on the current year project is progressing well with qualified new members making updates to the code regularly and goals often being met, such as functionality of interactive elements in 3D.</p>
